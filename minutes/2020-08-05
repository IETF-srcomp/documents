Work Model:
1.	Wim/Daren will provide some suggestion on categories (we should get agreement on categories at first)
2.	Collect the requirements in parallel
3.	Sort the requirements to different categories  
4.	Discuss the items following the categories periodically 

Note:
If we make important decision, we should ensure all members on line. Decisions should be sent to mail list and everyone should acknowledge. Then the decisions will be used in the group.
